Order of Testing Steps: 

Hypothesis testing

0 Pose your question (“Is this coin fair?”)

1 Find the relevant population (“‘Flip results’ from this coin”) How do you relate the Q to the data

2 Specify a null hypothesis H0H0 (“The chance of heads is 50%”) - have to disprove the null, it's the opposite of what you are looking for 

3 Choose test statistic informing H0H0 (“The number of heads observed”)

4 Collect data (“Flip the coin nn times”)

5 Calculate the test statistics (“Count the total heads flipped”)

6 Reject the null hypothesis if the test statistic looks “strange” compared to its sampling distribution under the null hypothesis; otherwise, fail to reject the null hypothesis
