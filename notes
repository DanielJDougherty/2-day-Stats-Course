Supervised Learning = AI
unsupervised - CX Clusters

Statistic is a Function of a data
Descriptive statistics - mean, median, skewness… Properties of the Distro
Inferential statistics - hypothesis testing, interval estimation… mix models and data.  know which factors in matrix is most impactful to target
Predictive analytics - supervised learning: regression, classification… - Don't care what is related, but will best match. Most certainty
Prescriptive analytics - unsupervised learning, recommender systems… - mix of infer and predict - Recommendation engines


Sample Space:
  Example (six sided Die)
  X1 - x2 - x3 - X4, X5, X6
  1 of 6 probability if it's a fair Die
  Proper event can not exist outside of Sample space

  Outcomes:

  Event: examples in cards - Half Heads, Odds, Spades

LEARN  Set operations: THIS IS HOW YOU GET TO LAW OF probability
  A U B  - A unioned with B
  Prob Broncos are in super bowl and I am watching
  Prob of either happening - then prob of both happening
  Intersection is upside down U



  Can you demonstrate De Morgan’s laws in Python?

  A random variable XX is a function that maps outcomes ss from its sample space SS onto the real numbers x∈Rx∈R, i.e.,
  I rolled my die ten times woudl be x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6...



  a = set(["A","B","C","D"])
  b = set(["C","D","E","F"])
  sample_space = set(["A","B","C","D","E","F","G"]

  >>> a.intersection(b)
  set(['C', 'D'])
  >>> a.difference(b)
  set(['A', 'B'])
  >>> a.union(b))
  set(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'])
  >>> complement_a = sample_space.difference(a)
